django-generic-flatblocks
=========================

If you want to add tiny snippets of text to your site, manageable by the admin
backend, you would use either django-chunks_ or django-flatblocks_. However, both
of them had one problem: you are limited to a prefefined content field; a "text"
field in chunks and in flatblocks a "title" and "text" field.

django-generic-flatblocks solves this problem as it knows nothing about the 
content itself. You *attach* your hand made content node (a simple model) where
you can define any fields you want.
